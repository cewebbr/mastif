Executive Summary\n- **Objective:** Verify the existence of the BBC Culture article, retrieve its full content, and evaluate the quality of any embedded image‑description (alt‑text) metadata.  \n- **Outcome of Step 1:** The article **cannot be accessed** via standard HTTP requests or public web archives. The server returns a **404 Not Found** (or, in some cases, a bot‑blocking 403) response, and no archived snapshots exist for the exact URL. Consequently, no HTML, images, or alt‑text can be examined at this time.  \n- **Key Insight:** Without a reachable copy of the article, any analysis of its image‑description quality is impossible. The missing page may be a future‑dated placeholder, a removed piece, or simply a non‑existent URL.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Background & Context\n- **Source Under Review:** BBC Culture, a freely accessible sub‑section of the BBC website that publishes cultural commentary, reviews, and feature pieces.  \n- **Target Article:** Supposed review titled *“Avatar: Fire and Ash”* dated **15 December 2025**. The URL follows BBC’s standard pattern (`/culture/article/YYYYMMDD‑slug‑review`).  \n- **Why Image‑Description Matters:** Under WCAG 2.2 (Success Criterion 1.1.1) and BBC’s own editorial standards, every meaningful image must have an accurate, concise, and context‑appropriate textual alternative",

The inquiry employed four complementary detection methods that are publicly accessible:\n\n| Detection Method | What it looks for | Result for this video |\n|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Player UI (Audio‑track selector)** | “Audio” submenu entry labelled *Audio description* (or similar) | **No description entry found** |\n| **Network‑level manifest inspection** | DASH (`.mpd`) or HLS (`.m3u8`) manifest containing an `<AdaptationSet>` or `#EXT-X-MEDIA` entry with `role=\"description\"` or a label containing “description” | **Manifest contains only a single audio representation** (no description role) |\n| **YouTube Data API (v3) query** | `audioTracks` array with an object where `\"type\": \"DESCRIPTION\"` | **API response does not list any audio‑track of type DESCRIPTION** |\n| **yt‑dlp / youtube‑dl format dump** | Secondary audio format flagged with `description` or `audio_description` in the format list | **Only one",

Consequently, **no concrete, page‑specific findings** can be reported at this time.  \n- **What was accomplished:**  \n  1. A **complete methodological framework** (Step 1 – Initial Retrieval & Overview, and Step 2 – Sensory‑Characteristics Assessment) was documented in detail.  \n  2. All **tools, techniques, and evidence‑capture procedures** required for a rigorous audit were identified and described.  \n  3. A **template for reporting** actual findings (once the page content is supplied) has been prepared.  \n- **Next steps:** Obtain the missing artefacts (HTML source, screenshots, or a screen‑recording) and re‑run the audit using the prescribed workflow",
