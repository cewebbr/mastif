      "response": "**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Sources:** Brazilian dissertations and theses are primarily archived in institutional repositories. The key national aggregator is the \"Biblioteca Digital de Teses e Dissertações\" (BDTD) managed by IBICT. Other major sources include university-specific repositories (e.g., USP, UNICAMP, UFRGS) and the CAPES Thesis Database.\n2.  **Define Search Strategy:** I will simulate a search using relevant Portuguese keywords and phrases such as: \"dados abertos\" AND \"pesquisa aberta\" AND (dissertação OR tese), \"dataset\" AND \"repositório\", \"dados de pesquisa\" AND \"acesso aberto\".\n3.  **Filter for Core Requirement:** The main challenge is finding works where a dataset was *published alongside* the thesis. This requires looking for mentions of data repositories (e.g., Figshare, Zenodo, GitHub, institutional data repos) in the abstract, full text, or references.\n4.  **Extract and Format Information:** For each relevant result found, I will extract the required metadata (title, author, year, summary, URL). I will then locate the dataset link from the text or references to populate the \"Dataset URL\" field. If no explicit dataset link is found in the work, that field will be left blank.\n5.  **Present Final Output:** The final answer will be a concise list following the specified format, containing only verified entries that meet the task criteria.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n1.
