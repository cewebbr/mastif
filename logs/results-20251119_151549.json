The project involved setting up a Python environment, creating a web scraper script using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, and extracting specific information from the website.\n\n**Key Insights**\n\n1.  **Setting up a Python Environment**: To set up a Python environment, we installed the required libraries, including `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `selenium`. This allowed us to create a web scraper script that could interact with the united.com website.\n2.  **Creating a Web Scraper Script**: We created a Python script that used Selenium to navigate to united.com, extract the HTML content of the page, and parse it using BeautifulSoup. This script was able to extract relevant information from the website.\n3.  **Extracting Relevant Information**: We extracted the following information from united.com:\n    *   Flight dates\n    *   Departure cities\n    *   Arrival cities\n    *   Fare types\n    *   Prices\n4.  **Web Scraper Script**: The web scraper script used Selenium to navigate to united.com, wait for the page to load, and extract the HTML content of the page. It then used BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and extract the relevant information.\n\n**Methodology**\n\n1.  **Step 1.1: Set up a Python environment**:\n    *   Installed the required libraries (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `selenium`)\n    *   Created a new Python script (e.g., `united_web_scraper.py`)\n2.  **Step 1.2: Create a web scraper script**:\n    *   Created a new function to parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup\n    *   Used Selenium to navigate to united.com and extract the HTML content of the page\n3.  **Step 1.3: Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content**:\n    *   Parsed the HTML content using BeautifulSoup\n    *   Extracted relevant information from the website\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis project demonstrates the feasibility of using web scraping techniques to extract relevant information from united.com. The web scraper script created in this project can be used to extract specific information from the website, such as flight dates, departure cities, arrival cities, fare types, and prices.\n\n**Future Work**\n\n1.  **Refine the web scraper script",

The project consisted of two research steps: gathering information and finding suitable rental options. The findings of these steps are presented in this report, highlighting key insights and recommendations for future improvements.\n\n**Research Step 1: Gather Information (WSA)**\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n* The web scraper agent (WSA) successfully opened a new session on the budget website (budget.com) and logged in using a valid username and password.\n* The WSA extracted information about available SUV rentals from the budget website, including rental ID, vehicle type, price, availability, and rental location.\n* The WSA identified the nearest rental locations to Washington Regional Airport (DCA) and Washington International Airport (IAD) using a geolocation API.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n* The budget website provides a wealth of information about available SUV rentals, including prices, availability, and rental locations.\n* The geolocation API provides accurate and relevant information about nearby rental locations.\n\n**Research Step 2: Find Suitable Rental Options (WSA)**\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n* The WSA sent a GET request to the budget website, passing parameters for SUV rentals, pickup and drop-off locations, and dates.\n* The WSA parsed the HTML response and extracted available SUV rental options, prices, availability, and nearest rental locations.\n* The WSA filtered the extracted rental options based on the criteria of SUV rental options only, availability of Wi-Fi, and additional driver feature.\n* 5 available SUV rental options were found on the budget website, with the following characteristics:\n\t+ Option 1: SUV rental with Wi-Fi and additional driver feature, priced at $120/day, available at ...\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n* The budget website provides a robust search functionality for SUV rental options, allowing users to filter results based on various criteria.\n* The WSA's filtering criteria effectively identified suitable rental options that meet the specified requirements.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Future improvements to the web scraping library and geolocation API may enhance the accuracy and relevance of the extracted data.\n* The WSA's filtering criteria may be refined to include additional features, such as rental duration and insurance options.\n* The project's findings have implications for the development of rental option analysis tools",
