None was present.  \n3. **Check video metadata & description** – Scanned the video title, description, and “Show more” section for any textual indication that a sign‑language interpretation is provided (e.g., “Includes sign‑language interpreter”, “Sign language version available”). No such statements were found.  \n4. **Examine caption tracks** – Opened the “Subtitles/CC” menu to view available tracks. YouTube only lists caption languages (e.g., English, Spanish). Sign‑language tracks are not represented as caption tracks, and none were listed.  \n5. **Search for structured data** – Reviewed the page source for schema.org VideoObject properties such as `hasPart` or `accessibilityFeature` that could declare a sign‑language version. No relevant markup was detected.  \n6. **Determine outcome** – Because the page provides no explicit indication that a sign‑language interpretation exists, and because the video content itself cannot be inspected automatically for a hidden interpreter, the presence of sign language cannot be confirmed nor denied.\n\n---\n\n### Result  \n\n| Success Criteria | URL | Instance | Test Result | Confidence Score | Code context | Rationale |\n|------------------|-----|----------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------|\n| 1.2.6 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKL_JhJbrHA | 1 | CT | 0.30 | N/A (YouTube player UI) | The YouTube video page does not display any explicit indication (UI element, metadata, description text, or structured data) that a sign‑language interpretation is provided for the prerecorded video. Without viewing the video content itself or creator‑provided documentation, it is impossible to determine whether sign language is available, resulting in a “Cannot Tell” outcome with low confidence. |\n\n**Interpretation of the result**  \n- **CT (Cannot Tell)** means the evaluator cannot ascertain compliance with 1.2.6 based on the available information.  \n- The confidence score of **0.30** reflects the limited visibility of sign‑language information on YouTube pages and the inability to programmatically verify the video’s visual content.  \n\n---  \n\n*Prepared by an Accessibility Expert (WCAG 2.2 Specialist) using manual inspection of the YouTube page and its associated metadata.*",
