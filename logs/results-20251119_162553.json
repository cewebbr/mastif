Each entry includes a brief description, primary use‑case, and links to download or learn more.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Screen‑Reader Enhancements\\n- **NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)** – Free, open‑source screen reader for Windows. Works well with most browsers and supports a wide range of extensions for better navigation of complex web apps.\\n- **VoiceOver (macOS / iOS)** – Built‑in screen reader with robust VoiceOver Rotor for quick navigation of headings, landmarks, and form controls.\\n- **ChromeVox** – Google’s screen‑reader extension for Chrome and Chrome OS; useful for quick testing of ARIA roles and live‑region announcements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Browser Extensions for Visual Accessibility\\n- **High Contrast / Dark Reader** – Toggles high‑contrast color schemes or dark mode on any site, improving readability for low‑vision users.\\n- **Read Aloud** – Text‑to‑speech extension that reads page content aloud, with adjustable speed, voice, and language.\\n- **Zoom Text** – Provides smooth page‑zoom, custom font scaling, and cursor magnification beyond native browser capabilities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Keyboard‑Navigation Aids\\n- **Vimium / Surfingkeys** – Keyboard‑centric navigation extensions that let you scroll, open links, and interact with pages using Vim‑style shortcuts, reducing reliance on a mouse.\\n- **Keynav** – Enables you to move focus between interactive elements with simple keystrokes, useful for sites with poor focus management.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Accessibility Testing & Debugging Tools (useful for developers and power users)\\n- **axe DevTools (Chrome/Firefox extension)** – Automated accessibility audit that highlights missing ARIA attributes, color‑contrast issues, and more.\\n- **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)** – Visual overlay that marks errors, alerts, and structural elements directly on the page.\\n- **Screen Reader Emulator (NVDA + Web Speech API)** – Simulates screen‑reader behavior for quick testing without a full screen‑reader install.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Assistive Input & Alternative Interaction\\n- **Speech Recognition (Web Speech API)** – Browser‑based dictation that can fill forms, trigger navigation, or execute custom commands via voice.\\n- **Eye‑Tracking / GazePointer** – Software (e.g., Tobii Dynavox) that maps eye movement to cursor control, allowing hands‑free browsing.\\n- **Switch Control (iOS / Android)** – Enables navigation using external switches or adaptive devices; integrates with system UI for seamless web access.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6. Content Simplification & Re‑formatting\\n- **Mercury Reader / Reader Mode (Firefox/Chrome)** – Strips away clutter, ads, and navigation bars, presenting a clean, linear reading view that is easier for screen readers and dyslexic users.\\n- **OpenDyslexic Font Extension** – Replaces page fonts with a dyslexia‑friendly typeface, improving character discrimination.\\n- **Textise.** – Converts web pages to plain‑text versions, removing complex layouts and scripts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 7. Mobile‑Specific Tools\\n- **TalkBack (Android)** – Built‑in screen reader with gesture support; works with Chrome’s accessibility settings.\\",

Yvette Clarke (D‑NY) among others.  \\n**Reference:** https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2548  \\n**Summary:**\\nThe revised Algorithmic Accountability Act seeks to require companies that deploy high‑risk AI systems on publicly accessible websites to conduct independent impact assessments covering bias, privacy, and security. The bill mandates that the results be submitted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which would gain authority to enforce corrective actions, fines, or mandatory redesigns. It also establishes a public registry of AI systems used for content recommendation, advertising, or decision‑making, aiming to increase transparency for consumers and regulators.\\n\\nA second major component is the creation of a federal AI Oversight Board within the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). This board would develop model standards for explainability and auditability, coordinate with state‑level AI regulations, and issue guidance on cross‑border data flows involving AI‑generated content. Critics argue the bill may stifle innovation, while supporters claim it is essential to curb discriminatory outcomes and protect user privacy.\\n\\n---\\n### European Union\\n**Proposal:** *Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) – Final Adoption Phase*  \\n**Proposed by:** European Commission, championed by President Ursula von der Leyen and Commissioner Thierry Breton.  \\n**Reference:** https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-approach-artificial-intelligence  \\n**Summary:**\\nThe AI Act, now in its final legislative stage, classifies AI systems into four risk tiers (unacceptable, high, limited, minimal) and imposes proportionate obligations. For high‑risk AI used on the web—such as deep‑fakes, recommendation engines, and biometric identification—the Act requires conformity assessments, post‑market monitoring, and a mandatory “risk‑management system.” Providers must publish detailed documentation, including datasets, training methodologies, and performance metrics, in a publicly accessible repository.\\n\\nMember states will enforce the Act through national supervisory authorities coordinated by the newly established European Artificial Intelligence Board (EAIB). The legislation also introduces a “sandbox” regime for experimental AI, allowing innovators to test systems under regulatory supervision. While the AI Act aims to create a single market for trustworthy AI, some industry groups warn that the compliance burden could disadvantage European start‑ups compared with U.S. and Asian competitors.\\n\\n---\\n### United Kingdom\\n**Proposal:** *Artificial Intelligence Regulation Bill*  \\n**Proposed by:** Minister for AI and Digital Strategy, Michelle Donelan, supported by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).  \\n**Reference:** https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-bill  \\n**Summary:**\\nThe UK’s AI Regulation Bill targets AI systems that influence public opinion, electoral processes, or consumer decisions on the internet. It introduces a licensing regime for “high‑impact” AI, requiring providers to register with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and submit a “Transparency Statement” describing the system",

After the methodology, I list the most relevant works I was able to retrieve (all are openly accessible through the CAPES Theses Portal, the Brazilian Digital Library of Theses – BDTD, or institutional repositories).\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How I tackled the request  \n\n| Step | Action | Tools / Sources | Rationale |\n|------|--------|----------------|-----------|\n| **1.1** | Define search strings in Portuguese & English (to capture the bilingual nature of Brazilian academia). | `(\"dados abertos\" OR \"open data\") AND (\"pesquisa aberta\" OR \"open research\") AND (\"dataset\" OR \"conjunto de dados\")` | Captures works that discuss open data *and* mention a concrete dataset. |\n| **1.2** | Run the query on the **CAPES Theses Portal** (https://bancodeteses.capes.gov.br) – the most comprehensive catalogue of Brazilian graduate works. | Filters: Country = Brazil; Document type = Dissertação/Thesis; Year = 2015‑2024. | CAPES indexes theses from every Brazilian university and provides direct download links (PDF/HTML). |\n| **1.3** | Run the same query on the **BDTD** (http://bdtd.ibict.br) – the national digital library for theses & dissertations. | Same filters; also limited to open‑access items. | BDTD aggregates institutional repositories that sometimes host supplemental files (datasets). |\n| **1.4** | Cross‑check results on **Google Scholar** and on the **institutional repositories** of the top‑producing universities (USP, UNICAMP, UFRJ, UFSC, UFPE, UFMG). | Use `site:repositorio.unicamp.br \"dados abertos\"` etc. | Many authors upload the dataset in a separate “supplementary material” folder that Google Scholar indexes. |\n| **1.5** | For each candidate work, verify two things: 1) The thesis explicitly discusses *open data/open research* as a research object; 2) The author **publishes the dataset** (either as a DOI‑linked repository – e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Harvard Dataverse – or as a downloadable zip in the university’s repository). | Open the PDF → search for “doi”, “dataset”, “repositório”, “Zenodo”, “Figshare”. | Guarantees the work meets the “datasets were published with research results” criterion. |\n| **1.6** | Record bibliographic details, URL to the thesis, URL/DOI of the dataset, and a one‑sentence summary of the contribution. | Export to a short table. | Provides a ready‑to‑use answer for the requester. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Core Philosophy – “Assist + Automate”\n\n| Goal | How we achieve it |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Make content perceivable** | Use screen‑reader‑friendly rendering, OCR, and text‑extraction tools. |\n| **Make navigation operable** | Keyboard‑only drivers, custom shortcuts, and voice‑command layers. |\n| **Make interaction understandable** | AI‑driven summarisation, context‑aware hints, and form‑field auto‑completion. |\n| **Make content robust** | Automated testing/repair loops that inject missing ARIA, fix broken focus order, and expose hidden elements. |\n\nThe toolkit below is organized around these four pillars and can be mixed‑and‑matched depending on the barrier you face (e.g., missing alt text, inaccessible modal dialogs, dynamic content that never receives focus, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 2. “Assist” Layer – Assistive‑Technology‑Friendly Add‑Ons\n\n| Category | Tool | Platform | What it solves | Quick‑Start |\n|----------|------|----------|----------------|-------------|\n| **Screen‑Reader Enhancers** | **ChromeVox** (extension) | Chrome/Edge | Gives a built‑in screen‑reader for browsers that lack OS‑level SR support (useful on thin‑client VMs). | Install → enable → press `Ctrl+Alt+Z` to toggle. |\n| | **NVDA** (free) | Windows | Full‑featured screen reader; works with any browser. | Download → run → configure “Speech → Synthesizer” for preferred voice. |\n| **Keyboard‑Only Navigation** | **Vimium‑C** (extension) | Chrome/Firefox | Vim‑style keyboard shortcuts to jump to links, scroll, click, fill forms. | Install → press `?` for cheat‑sheet. |\n| | **Surfingkeys** | Chrome/Firefox | Similar to Vimium but scriptable (you can map custom keys to focus hidden elements). | Install → edit `config.js` to add `mapkey('ga','Open ARIA landmarks',()=>{…})`. |\n| **Voice‑Control** | **Voice Control for Chrome** (extension) | Chrome | Speak commands like “click next”, “fill email”. Uses Web Speech API. | Install → click microphone icon → start speaking. |\n| | **Dragon NaturallySpeaking** (paid) | Windows/macOS | System‑wide voice dictation + custom macros for web actions. | Install → create macro “Press Tab until element with label ‘Submit’ appears”. |\n| **Text Extraction / OCR** | **Project Naptha** (extension) | Chrome/Edge | Lets you select, copy, translate text inside images. | Install → drag to select text in an image. |\n| | **Microsoft OneNote OCR** (desktop/app) | Windows/macOS | Paste screenshot → right‑click “Copy Text from Picture”. | Useful for infographics lacking alt text. |\n| **Contrast & Color** | **High Contrast** (extension) | Chrome/Edge | Forces black‑on‑white or white‑on‑black rendering. | Install → toggle with `Alt+Shift+H`. |\n| | **Color Contrast Analyzer** (extension) | Chrome/Firefox | Shows contrast ratio on hover; can suggest a WCAG‑compliant palette. | Install → click the eye icon, hover over any element. |\n| **Magnification / Zoom** | **Zoom Page WE** (extension) | Chrome/Firefox | Fine‑grained zoom (25 % steps), independent per‑tab. | Install → use `Ctrl+Alt+M` to increase/decrease. |\n| **Reading Mode** | **Mercury Reader** (extension) | Chrome | Strips clutter, presents article in a clean, accessible layout. | Install → click the icon or press `Alt+R`. |\n| **ARIA‑Overlay** | **ARIA‑Helper** (extension) | Chrome/Firefox | Highlights missing/invalid ARIA attributes, can inject temporary labels. | Install → open DevTools → “ARIA‑Helper” panel. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. “Automate” Layer – Scripting & Testing",

Capture the name of the sponsoring minister, senator, MP, or agency.  \n5. **Validate recency** – check the latest amendment or implementation date; exclude proposals that have not progressed beyond “draft”.  \n6. **Extract key elements** – for each law note:  \n   - **Jurisdiction & official title**  \n   - **Proposing entity / key sponsor(s)** (minister, committee, senator, etc.)  \n   - **Core web‑focused provisions** (labeling of AI‑generated content, transparency of recommendation algorithms, bans on certain AI‑training data, liability rules, enforcement mechanisms).  \n   - **Reference URLs** (official PDF, legislative tracker, or reputable news analysis).  \n7. **Synthesize** – write a concise two‑paragraph summary that explains the purpose of the law, the main obligations for web‑based operators, and any notable controversies or implementation challenges.  \n8. **Organise the final report** – group the laws by country",
