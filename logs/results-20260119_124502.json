      "response": "**Web‑Automation Specialist – Reasoning & Deliverable**  \nBelow is a step‑by‑step description of how I would locate Brazilian dissertations / theses that explicitly **publish the underlying datasets together with the research results** (i.e., “open data” / “open research” works). After the methodology, I present a curated list of the most relevant documents I was able to identify, together with the dataset links, short abstracts and bibliographic details.\n\n---\n\n## 1️⃣  How I approached the search  \n\n| Step | Action | Rationale / Tools |\n|------|--------|-------------------|\n| **1. Define search terms (Portuguese & English)** | `dados abertos`, `open data`, `pesquisa aberta`, `open science`, `conjunto de dados`, `dataset`, `dissertação`, `tese`, `Brasil` | Brazilian scholars usually write the title/keywords in Portuguese, but many also include English equivalents. |\n| **2. Choose repositories that index Brazilian graduate works** | • **CAPES – Teses e Dissertações** (https://teses.capes.gov.br)  <br>• **Universidade Federal** institutional DSpace portals (USP, UFRJ, UFSC, UNICAMP, UFMG, etc.)  <br>• **Lattes** CV (search for “Open Data” in the “Produção Bibliográfica” section)  <br>• **Google Scholar** (advanced search)  <br>• **Open Science Framework (OSF)**, **Zenodo**, **Figshare**, **Harvard Dataverse** (filter by author affiliation “Brazil”) | CAPES aggregates the full‑text PDFs of all Brazilian master’s theses and PhD dissertations. Institutional DSpace portals often host the *datasets* as separate “supplementary material”. OSF/Zenodo are the most common places Brazilian researchers deposit open data. |\n| **3. Build a Boolean query for each platform** | Example (CAPES):  <br>`(dados abertos OR open data OR pesquisa aberta OR open science) AND (dissertação OR tese) AND (dataset OR conjunto de dados) AND (pdf)`  <br>Example (Google Scholar):  <br>`allintitle:\"dados abertos\" \"dissertação\" site:.br`  <br>Example (OSF):  <br>`affiliation:\"Universidade*\" AND (open data OR open science) AND \"thesis\"` | Using the “allintitle” or “site:.br” limits the results to Brazilian academic works. Adding “dataset” forces the search engine to surface works that mention a deposited dataset. |\n| **4. Filter for **open‑data evidence**  | • Look inside the PDF for a “Data Availability” or “Conjunto de Dados Disponível em” statement.  <br>• Verify that the link points to a persistent URL (doi.org, zenodo.org, osf.io, figshare.com, institutional DSpace).  <br>• Confirm that the dataset is **publicly accessible** (no login, no embargo). | Many theses only *mention* that data are “available upon request”. Those are excluded – we keep only works that provide a direct, open link. |\n| **5. Capture bibliographic metadata** | Title, Author, Year, Program (MSc/PhD), Institution, Advisor(s), DOI/Handle of thesis, DOI/Handle of dataset, Keywords, Short abstract. | This",
